              This project seeks to cross compare the frequencies at which
              different Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) Lines
              resonate, determining the implications for human health of each.

            <p>
              In determining the frequencies that each line resonated at, an
              experimental methodology that was able to cross compare the lines
              consistently and accurately was needed. In examining different
              options, eventually it was decided that Phyphox, a mobile phone
              app that takes accurate data from a phoneâ€™s accelerometer, sound
              receptors, and positioning tools, was the best option to
              consistently and conveniently measure each line.
            </p>
            <p>
              In data collection, the Phyphox app was opened and set flat on the floor of each rail line, being set down perpendicular to the forward motion of the train and taking readings 
              of the low frequency vibrations in the acceleration, travel, and deceleration of each ride. The frequency vibrations had three degrees of freedom, the acceleration being read in the 
              x, y, and z directions, but for the simplicity of analysis, the net acceleration was the only data analyzed.

            <p></p>

            <p>
              At the same time the vibrations of the train were being analyzed, another phone did an audio spectrum (high frequency) 
              measurement also using the Phyphox app. Thus, each line had both low-frequency and high-frequency vibration data collected 
              that could then be sent through a Fourier transformation for analysis of frequency spectrums. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Data was collected on the commuter rail, orange line, blue line,
              and red line (the green line was down the day of data collection),
              and the car number of each car that analysis was done in was noted
              so that different car types could be accounted for as well.

            <p>
              The vibration data was analyzed with the discrete Fourier
              transform (DFT), also known as the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
              The DFT finds the magnitude of various frequencies present in a
              discretized signal. This allows for the elimination of noise and
              reveals the most prevalent frequencies in a given signal. The
              frequencies are normalized based on the sampling rate, then
              plotted on a graph of amplitude versus frequency.

              All data analysis and visualization was performed in MATLAB and
