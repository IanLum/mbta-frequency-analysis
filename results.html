              Frequency analysis was done on the orange, red, and blue line as
              well as the commuter rail. Fourier transformations were done on
              each data set and the highest amplitude frequencies were extracted
              from the data and put into graphs, with their respective peaks
              being found.

              Below are pictures of both low frequency and high frequency
              transformations for both the low-frequency vibrations and
              high-frequency vibrations. Two different data collections were
              done for low-frequency versus high-frequency data, as it allowed
              for more exact data collection and ease in analyzing and
              transforming data.

                Orange Line: There was a significant peak at 10Hz, 14Hz, and
                47Hz.
              </li>

                Blue Line: There was a significant peak at 43Hz and 47 Hz.

                Commuter Rail: There was also a significant peak at 3Hz and
                23Hz.

              It was interesting seeing that each subway line consistently had a
              frequency oscillation of 47Hz â€”probably indicating a design in the
              tracks or subway design that was consistent across all lines
              despite the cars being different models. The highest amplitude
              oscillations were on the blue and orange line (something that
              could be qualitatively felt in the shakiness of each line).
